"Since its establishment in 2001, GBIF has established an effective "
"infrastructure that delivers primary biodiversity data and multiplies the "
"impact of hundreds of other organizations and initiatives. However, the "
"influence and extent of GBIF’s global network remain relatively "
"underappreciated."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: 100.en.adoc:6
msgid ""
"To capitalize on its successes to date, and to fulfil the needs of the "
"biodiversity science and policy communities, the GBIF community must "
"continuously refine and refocus its efforts to communicate the fundamental "
"value of this unique and highly effective enterprise to each of the "
"audiences it serves. This task is best conducted with clear articulation of "
"those audiences, how and why they should support or participate in GBIF, and "
"how best to deliver on the promise that inspired the establishment of GBIF."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: 100.en.adoc:8
msgid ""
"The challenge of communicating clearly about GBIF begins even with the "
"simple description of what it is and what it does. This is in part because "
"GBIF is not a formal, treaty-based institution, but the product of a "
"voluntary collaboration between Participant countries and organizations, "
"with an international coordinating body (the Secretariat) funded jointly by "
"those Participants. So how does one best describe GBIF?"
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: 100.en.adoc:10
msgid ""
"More than a formal structure or entity, GBIF is a pledge towards common "
"actions and goals. A pledge to make biodiversity data freely and openly "
"available. A pledge to enable their constructive use and application across "
"relevant research and policy realms. A pledge to continuously improve and "
"increase these data over time. And a pledge to be at the forefront of "
"building a culture of open data and transparency."

"The body of individuals and institutions coalescing around this pledge, even "
